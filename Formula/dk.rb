# THIS FILE IS THE SOURCE OF TRUTH for mcavage/homebrew-tap's Formula/dk.rb.
#
# The `update homebrew tap` step in .github/workflows/release.yml copies this
# file over the tap's copy on every release and then rewrites exactly three
# things: `version`, all four `url`s, and all four `sha256`s. Everything else,
# notably `def install`, ships to users verbatim from here. Editing the tap
# directly will be silently overwritten by the next release; edit this file.
#
# WHY IT LIVES HERE. The tarball's contents and the formula's `install` block
# have to agree, and if they live in two repos nothing compares them. That is
# not hypothetical: the sibling pix formula shipped a broken release exactly
# this way, by installing a man page the tarball had stopped carrying. A test
# in this repo asserts this formula only installs paths `make dist` actually
# stages into the tarball, so that drift fails at review time rather than at
# someone's terminal.
#
# The version/url/sha256 values below are LAST RELEASE'S. They are placeholders
# the release job rewrites; do not hand-maintain them.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Run `dk doctor` to check credentials and connectivity, and `dk help`
      to get started.

      dk cannot place orders. It prices a BOM and hands off a cart URL;
      buying stays a human action in a browser.
